# Full Stack Typescript

This project is a POC for a strict full stack typescript application. It enforces both the client and the server with 
exact same interfaces. 

## Folder structure

- Angular application `src/app`
- Express server side application `server/src`  

## Todo

- add a tslint rule to disallow usage of native functions and enforce usage of the strict once
